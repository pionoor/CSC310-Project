The E/R diagram is based on a simplified university system model. The structure has six entities and six relations.  We chose essential entities that were relatable and present a decent database model.

We encountered two design challenges throughout the designing phase. Initially, key determination was a bit challenging for some of the relationships because we didn’t want to add an ID for each table. Instead we wanted to come up with multi-attribute key. The second challenge was determining the correct type of relationship (many-to-many, one-to-one, etc…) The third challenge was properly integrating a weak-entity relationship into the model. The team decided against integrating a weak entity due to time constraints.

   Brainstorming, E/R diagram construction, writing report writing
