The program developed for part 5 of the CSCE 310 group project is an embedded MySQL interface written in Java which utilizes the JDBC API. The program initially creates a connection between the user's machine and the project MySQL database using JDBC. Next, the program displays the main menu which allows the user to select from multiple database interactions. These interactions include: simple and advanced query, update, insert, delete, and quit. Selection of either the advanced or simple query option sends a predetermined SQL query to the database and displays the return values to the user. Selection of the remaining options (update, delete) will prompt the user to first select which table to alter, followed by a prompt to enter the values which need to be altered, followed by the value to change to. Lastly, selection of the insert option prompts the user to select which table to insert into, followed by a prompt to input the desired entry values. Finally, the user can select the "Quit" option to exit the program. Selection of the "Quit" option terminates the JDBC connection, and provides a break condition to end the program.
